## How to run
Clone this repository and start up a php server on a localhost server with: php -S localhost:8000 - here I am using port 8000 for as an example. 
Open up your localhost in different cookie areas, as the site uses cookies, so either a normal and incognito window, or two different browsers. 
Join or create a room and start sending messages! The messaages should soon appear in the other session.
